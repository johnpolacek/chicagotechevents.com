If you are considering adopting or migrating to the Atlassian Cloud, this event is for you. Herzum’s team of experts will introduce the pro and cons of adopting the Atlassian Cloud and compare it to the other Atlassian deployments – including hybrid cloud adoption. We will discuss how to succeed with the adoption in the short/long term and how to migrate from other platforms, or from Atlassian on-prem solutions.

The agenda includes:
• Key features of the Atlassian Cloud.
• Key considerations when evaluating the Atlassian or Hybrid cloud adoption.
• Blended cloud alternatives, including AWS and Azure.
• Success stories and case studies.
• Lessons learned from Herzum’s migration experience.
• Discounts and incentive programs for Cloud adoptions.

Taking the time to plan the right approach will result in a successful adoption and/or migration to the Cloud. Whether you are migrating one instance, or are trying to merge and integrate multiple tools and instances, Herzum has the experience to help you succeed.

After the presentation, join the reception and networking event and continue the discussion with our experts over complimentary food and drinks. There is no charge for this event.
