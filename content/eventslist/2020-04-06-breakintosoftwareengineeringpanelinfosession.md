Join us for a panel of local industry experts to learn more about what a Software Engineer does day-to-day, what skills you need to be successful, and how to find a job in Chicago!

Afterwards, we'll be hosting an info session led by our Admissions Producer and Software Engineering Immersive instructor, as well as a tour of our new campus!
