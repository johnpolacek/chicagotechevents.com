In arcade mode, you pick from our carefully curated games at Redline VR. We have access to them all, but we bring you only the best. Our gear is the best too, currently featuring the HTC Vive Pro headset with haptic controllers,and a carefully considered playing area that will keep you safe. 

VR can be physical, so please dress in layers with shoes that can move. If you can comfortably see 5 feet in front of you, glasses probably won't be needed. Our headsets do comfortably fit over most glasses, but if you've got large frames, please consider contacts.
