It’s the night before Zendesk Showcase, our Customer Experience event, and we know you’ve traveled in to attend - for that, we want to thank you over cocktails, bites and brews at BLVD! 

 
Stop in and connect with fellow CX leaders and some of the Zendesk team before the full day of all things CX begins on Thursday. 

 
For those of you staying at the Ace Hotel, BLVD is a short, 5 minute walk away. Like Showcase, this is a free event, but be sure to register using the form to the right to attend. Cheers!
