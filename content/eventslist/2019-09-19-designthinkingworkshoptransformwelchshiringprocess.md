Apply real design thinking techniques to help Welch Packaging, a regional leading box manufacturer serving clients throughout the country, reimagine it's hiring process for production associates to remain competitive within a tightening labor market. Participants will be broken into teams, walked through design thinking activities, and present solutions at the end of the event. Winning teams of the friendly competition will receive tours of mHub, Chicagoâ€™s physical product accelerator.
