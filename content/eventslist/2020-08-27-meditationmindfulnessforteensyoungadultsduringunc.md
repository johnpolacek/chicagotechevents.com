Science shows that a regular mindfulness and meditation practice improves cognition, stabilizes stress, promotes emotional health and well-being, and increases attention and focus. This mindfulness and meditation session is specifically designed for young adults and teenagers that are dealing with stress and anxiety as a result of the pandemic. During this half hour session, we'll learn what buzzwords "mindfulness" and "meditation" mean, walk through a mindfulness exercise that taps into all five senses, and practice a guided breath meditation with a 200-hour certified yoga instructor.
