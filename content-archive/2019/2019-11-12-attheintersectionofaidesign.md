When discussing the future of work most experts predict that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be at the center of it all. Each year the biggest tech companies are pouring billions into their AI capabilities and many say an inflection point is on the horizon. Those prepared for it will be the best to navigate the new AI economy and help guide its development and application.

But where does this leave the design field? How can designers not only survive in the age of AI, but thrive and ensure that these new AI-centric products and services are being built to benefit us all?

Join General Assembly and Speculative Futures Chicago as we unpack how designers can work with AI and how we can effectively adapt to the currently-unfolding AI revolution.

After a moderated discussion with AI practitioners, we'll open up the floor to take questions from you.
