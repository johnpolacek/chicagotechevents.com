Here in Chicago, programming skills are your passport to the tech scene.

Free online resources and specialized coding bootcamps have made coding accessible to nearly anyone with the desire to build things, to make work more efficient, to solve problems, and much more.

Chicago entrepreneur Neal Sáles-Griffin is the perfect example. Come learn how he found his passion through programming and has gone on to build not only websites, but educational opportunities, a political campaign, and more.

Then get inspired to build something of your own--whether that’s a career, a business, a non-profit, or anything else that moves you--and walk away with actionable next steps.
