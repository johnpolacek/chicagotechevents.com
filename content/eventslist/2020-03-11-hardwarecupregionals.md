The Hardware Cup, the largest international pitch competition for early-stage Hardware Startups, will be heading to Chicago on March 11th at The Chicago Connectory. 

That night, 6 Midwest startups will compete for cash and prizes, and their shot at the $50,000 cash Grand Prize at the International Finals in May, along with finalists from 5 other US cities, and other international countries. 


Tickets are free and open to the public, but registration is required to attend.  This is an excellent opportunity for the community to see what startups are popping up in their city and to support their local entrepreneurs. It is also wonderful for networking, connecting with other businesses, and seeing new products! Light refreshments and snacks will be provided.
