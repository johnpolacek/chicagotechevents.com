Work wives. Groupchat girlfriends. Career confidants. We might call them something different -- but they’re the same in purpose.
Women colleagues that we can count on for advice before 1:1’s, encouragement before those big presentations, venting sessions after tough meetings or someone we can count on for a laugh during the workday. Our community. An alliance.

Sisterhood alliances empower us all to be a consistent source of support, strength and strategy when navigating career, life and beyond.

Join us for this unique talk with Jessica Williams, Blogger & Side Hustler at Tech Biz Gurl, on the topic of strategic sisterhood alliances this summer. RSVP here to reserve your spot!

This event is open to all genders and allies of marginalized and underrepresented genders.
