Application Security is hard when security is separated from your DevOps flow. Security has traditionally been the final hurdle in the development life cycle. Iterative development workflows can make security a release bottleneck. Your team doesn't have enough people to test all of your code, and hiring more analysts won't automatically reduce the friction between your app sec and engineering teams. Only testing major releases, or limiting tests to certain apps, leaves weak spots hackers can exploit. You need a way to balance risk and business agility. Instead of waiting for security at the end of the development process, you can include it with your DevOps workflow. You need DevSecOps process.
