Innovation comes from an intersection of art and commerce. It comes from creativity, which takes risk, saying yes to new ideas, and collaborating with those around you.

Kick-off 2019 with a hands-on improv workshop that will take you through a series of fun exercises and discussions designed to hone your skills in creativity, communication and entrepreneurship. Led by facilitators from Chicago’s Team Us Comedy, the workshop will help you explore the principles of improvisation in a comfortable setting so you can keep laughing and saying yes to new ideas and experiences all year long.

All workshop attendees will receive a complimentary ticket to a Team Us Comedy show, featuring the best sketch, improv, and stand-up comedians from America’s premier clubs, from The Second City to the Laugh Factory.
