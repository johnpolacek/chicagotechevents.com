St. Paul's Senior Services is here to make a senior living and the idea of living in a nursing home less stressful through our Educational Series, “Plan for Tomorrow, Today.” 

We will host several educational events throughout 2020 and 2021 with experts within the senior care industry.
Each event will address your most asked questions and include guidance from some of San Diego’s most knowledgeable people in senior care to help you make this journey with confidence. 

Topics that we will cover:

- Living and Care Options Explained: Memory Care, Assisted Living, Independent Living.
