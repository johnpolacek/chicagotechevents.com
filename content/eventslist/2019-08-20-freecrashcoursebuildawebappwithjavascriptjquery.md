JavaScript is the language of the browser. Every website you've ever used is built with JavaScript, with interaction powered by the popular jQuery library. Learn how to use JavaScript and jQuery and build a simple web app in this workshop.

Together we'll learn key jQuery concepts like manipulating the DOM and using event listeners to update our app in real time. Here is an example of a web app that was made by an attendee at one of our previous events: https://unique-heart.glitch.me/
