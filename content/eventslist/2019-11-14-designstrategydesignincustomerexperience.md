Grow, the professional education division of world-leading design leadership and management consultancy firm PARK will be offering two days of Design Leadership programming, November 14th & 15th, in Chicago.<br><br>
 
On November 15th, we'll dive into Design In Customer Experience. Companies can no longer stand out through manufacturing strength, distribution power or information mastery, we must embrace customer experience if we want to obtain a competitive edge in the marketplace today. In order to build a great experience, all functions that contribute to it need to be carefully aligned, and design will need to take on different moments in the process while continually aligning with other functions. This is the job of a design manager. He/she needs to leverage the unique capabilities of design and accordingly take a leading or supporting role in doing so.<br><br> 
Learn to: 
<br> 
* Learn how Design plays a role (or not) in the total Customer Experience
<br>* Learn how to inspire and influence stakeholders across your organization<br>
* Apply our CX Model on site, specifically for your organization
<br>* Take aways includes the Customer Experience Arena & checklist with one year access to online program materials
