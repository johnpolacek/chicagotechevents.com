Panelists will cover the state of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the technology sector and how organizations can build cultures where all employees can thrive. As a company (and an industry) we have work to do to increase diversity and build inclusion into our foundation. We’re all here to learn, and we look forward to bringing the technology community together at Nerd Therapy.
