Calling all coders and future DJ's! Join us for this interactive music coding workshop.

In this interactive workshop you will learn to code creatively by composing music in a range of different styles. You'll learn both the tools to take your artistry to the next level and the tools of a web developer in the process. Just bring your laptop, and we'll handle the rest.
