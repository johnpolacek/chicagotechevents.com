We'll cover how to identify who you should be networking with based on your career interests. Then, we'll create email templates that can be used to build strategic relationships with people at the companies you're most excited about. You'll leave the workshop knowing how to lead an informational interview, drive conversations about job opportunities, and secure an interview for your dream job.
