Figure out how to be your best when the pressure’s on. The ability to connect with others in an authentic way is the key to being a great speaker – and it carries over into the success of your business and personal life.

This hands-on workshop gives each student the chance to articulate their specific public speaking goals and give a 1 – 2 minute pitch/speech. You’ll receive expert feedback in a supportive environment and leave this workshop with the physical experience of being in front of a group.
