Overview:
Software's level of complexity and use keeps expanding at exponential levels. Likewise, the potential risks to health and loss of privacy follow suit.

Ransomeware attacks hold software programs hostage until you pay the culprit thousands of dollars. Life supporting and life sustaining health software grinds to a halt. Extracting personal healthcare information is another plague that has a huge financial incentive for hackers. Your software is running on thin ice.

FDA looks at software based on the risk to health associated with the software's use. Cybersecurity problems for software for life sustain devices, wireless networks for patient manage and home use devices open the gate for cyber intrusion, functional malware and total denial of access denial to an entire network of software, such as that used in hospitals and clinics. Who will help you? This becomes a self-help scenario; FDA and the FBI cannot protect you from the "bad guy."

An equally disastrous problem involves interoperability failures. If your software does not cross the bridge of software communication, that software becomes worthless.

Wireless technology, mobile apps and home use of software-based devices raise endless vulnerabilities. How you protect yourself and your customers in this swamp of disasters is critical.
