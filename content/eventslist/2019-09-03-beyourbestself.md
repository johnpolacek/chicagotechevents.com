“He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened.” ― Lao Tzu

Self-awareness has become a hot topic as of late, and for good reason! Self-awareness and mindfulness of ones inner qualities are the keys to building a successful career, connected relationships, and an overall happy life.

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the what, why, and how of self-awareness. During the course of the workshop, a number of facilitated conversations, individual tools, and group exercises will be used to explore the importance of self-awareness, the impact it has on our lives, and how we can start to actively build it.

While the scope and definitions of self-awareness are broad, this workshop aims to introduce key foundational distinctions and concepts that can stand alone, and, when properly nurtured over time lead to further growth and discovery.
