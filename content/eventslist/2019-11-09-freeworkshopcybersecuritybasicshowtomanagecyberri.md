Take cybersecurity into your own hands! We all rely on electronic information. But what would happen if it was stolen, corrupted or unavailable?

In this workshop, students will learn about why cybersecurity is important and the practices and tools that can help people and organizations protect their critical information. We will conduct exercises to examine some of the technology that is used to help protect computer systems and networks. Students will participate in online simulations showing how experts evaluate and manage cybersecurity risk.
