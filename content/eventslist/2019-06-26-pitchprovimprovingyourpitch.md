Are you a founder or co-founder raising capital? Do you wonder if you Pitch is really selling your company? Are you open to testing your pitch and giving others feedback on their Pitches? Would you like to have fun doing both? Join us for Pitch-prov where we'll combine the best of pitch coaching and improv to help you understand what others hear when you pitch your company. Most of the evening will be spent in breakout groups where you'll take turns doing your elevator pitch then learning how other interpret it through improv. Our fearless leader for this evening of learning is Mary Cait Walthall. She teaches improv at IO Theater in addition to working with startups on communication and culture. Some of her students will join us to coach the breakout groups and keep things moving.
