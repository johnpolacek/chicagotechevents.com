Some feel that education is the area in which VR and AR will make the most revolutionary impact on society. From AR tabletop displays that come alive in the classroom to watching the history of a neighborhood unfold through VR as the class field trip travels through time, education will be radically changed through immersive tech. How is this going to be rolled out across the educational field and who will get the first benefits and who might get left out?
