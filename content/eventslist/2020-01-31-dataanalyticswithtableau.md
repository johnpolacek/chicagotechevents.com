Data analytics is in the midst of an evolution. In todayâ€™s digital world, the practice of decision makers relying on information to be delivered to them is no longer sufficient to keep pace. Tableau is software that puts access to data, and the insights it can unlock, directly in the hands of those who need it.

Tableu is designed to help people see and understand data and offers a powerful yet intuitive and easy to use method of visually exploring & analyzing data for more effective decision making and strategizing.
