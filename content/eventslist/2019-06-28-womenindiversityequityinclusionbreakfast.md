We invite you to join us for this exclusive breakfast featuring women working in the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) space. We will take a deeper dive into the issues women face across industries and find solutions to how we can rise above the obstacles and thrive in today's growing fields of technology and beyond.
