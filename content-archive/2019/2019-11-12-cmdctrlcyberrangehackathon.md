Chicago CyberSecurity is teaming up with Security Innovation to offer attendees a fun "find the vulnerabilities" game (CTF) - CMD+CTRL Cyber Range - that shows how hackers break into websites and teaches the importance of secure coding habits. The CMD+CTRL Cyber Range is where players compete to find vulnerabilities, score points, and move up the leaderboard. Leveraging cheat sheets, attack tables, and expert led training sessions, see if you can hack us. Just bring your computer and evil inner-doer and you are ready to hack away!
