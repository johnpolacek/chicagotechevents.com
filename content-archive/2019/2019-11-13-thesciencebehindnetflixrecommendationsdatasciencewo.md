Dive into the data science and machine learning behind Netflix's recommendation algorithms.

Over 80% of the TV shows and movies we watch on Netflix are being discovered through its recommendation system. Join Flatiron School to explore the algorithm, data science, and machine learning behind how Netflix curates these recommendations, and learn how you can gain the skills to write your very own algorithms.

Our Data Science Coach Abhishek Kumar will walk us through how recommendation algorithms work, and how Netflix collects and analyzes data to deliver your next favorite show. 

Join us for a deep dive into data science and Netflix, check out the Flatiron School Chicago campus, and connect with our Data Science team.
