Curious about coding, but donâ€™t know where to begin? HTML & CSS is the perfect place to start. Here you'll learn the basic building blocks of a website, and how to style them while completing a series of challenges to help you master your new skills.

Together we'll work through a series of drills that will teach you the core concepts of HTML (tags, elements, and attributes), and the basics of CSS (selectors, properties, and values). All your work will be in a platform that will allow you to bring it home with you and continue to work on it after you leave.

Suggested Experience Level:
Beginner - no previous coding experience needed

What to Bring:
Laptop
Water bottle 

How to Find Us: 
The event will be held at MakeOffice River Loop located at 350 W. Wolf Point Plaza. For the easiest access, enter the Holiday Inn Wolf Point entrance.

Take the elevators to the 9th floor and go to your left, here you will find MakeOffices. SpotHero is the best parking app to use to get into the nearest spots for cheap rates.
