The typical "Hello World" example we see in C++ is

#include < iostream >
using namespace std;
int main()
{
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
}

Which just leaves the student with questions
about namespaces, cout and endl! What are these
constructs for? What do they mean? What do
they DO? Are there alternatives that give us
cleaner, more flexible code? At what cost? Can
this even change how we teach C++? We'll
discuss some alternatives and the impact they
have on our code, and possibly reconsider what
our new defaults should be.

Jason Turner has 2 decades of C++ experience and
is a regular conference speaker, developer, and
trainer. He is host of the YouTube channel C++
Weekly and co-host of CppCast, the first podcast
for C++ developers.
