In this fun and interactive workshop, learn secrets for more confident body language to amp your executive presence whether you are the boss or aspire to be one! Leading a team; consulting in different environments; interviewing for a new position; or developing a book of business—all need effective communication. With over 70% of our communication from nonverbal signals, learning the signals we send and receive is critical to our business success.

What signals do you send to others and how can you be more persuasive? Finally know what to do with your hand gestures! How do you give a handshake with a hidden message? Feel confident in any situation from networking to sales to presentations. Signals don’t change in new situations, so use the training in all aspects of your business!

Half of body language success is observing the signals others send to you. Learn to speak in the way others will best hear your message based on what you see in them! Save time and make more money with clear and effective communication where your verbal language and your nonverbal language work together congruently for the most impact.
