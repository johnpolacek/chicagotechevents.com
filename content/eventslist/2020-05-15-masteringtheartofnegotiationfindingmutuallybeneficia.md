From working with business partners and job candidates, to navigating your own compensation or buying a home or car, negotiation is a critical skill in our everyday lives. Become a master of negotiation in this program - learn how to identify negotiation opportunities, prepare for various situations, and achieve not just your desired result but learn how to drive to a mutually beneficial result for all parties. Using proven strategies from the Harvard Negotiation Project, this workshop will offer an overview of the theory and tactics of negotiations, a discussion of ways to manage the emotional dimensions of conflict resolution, and expose students to several key tools of awareness to approach negotiations to seek optimal, mutually agreeable outcomes. Participants will receive instruction, engage in mock negotiations, and receive direct feedback.
