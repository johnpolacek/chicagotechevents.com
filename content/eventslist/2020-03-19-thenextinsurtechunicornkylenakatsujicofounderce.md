They are called unicorns for good reason, they are freakin' rare and hardly ever seen, but right now my friends, you have the rare opportunity to meet the very next unicorn from our great city, Kyle Nakatsuji, co-founder of Clearcover. Startup Grind Chicago is the first to feature Kyle in a live fireside chat and you certainly will not want to miss out.
