Augmented Reality first came on the scene nearly 20 years ago, in the form of the first down marker in professional football, in the time since, Augmented, Virtual and Mixed reality have evolved at a rapid pace. VR and AR applications and hardware seems to have reached a tipping point. With new hardware at consumer-level prices, business and consumers alike are starting to add serious momentum to the space. In particular, enterprises stand to replace existing flat processes with AR or VR for areas like training and infrastructure management. Several technologies are working behind the scene to catalyze existing AR/VR technologies. These include: High Tech Displays, Lightweight Batteries, Global Application Development Platforms, and primarily, Computer Vision. The presentation will cover a brief history of human-computer interaction in 3D, the current state of affairs, and a forecast for what to expect in the next few years. We'll cover a few examples including from the most popular video games, enterprise applications, and cutting edge hardware. And most importantly, how this could impact you today if you're not already using XR.
