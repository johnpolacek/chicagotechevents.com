Before signing off for the holidays, take some time to reflect on your performance this past year. Performance Management is a critical part of your career advancement, but most professionals end up writing their assessment or feedback for peers at the last minute without much thought.

In this interactive workshop youâ€™ll learn what exactly you should communicate in your annual or mid-year review, how to translate your work in the most compelling and effective way possible, and how to write feedback for anyone - managers, peers, direct reports, and external partners.
