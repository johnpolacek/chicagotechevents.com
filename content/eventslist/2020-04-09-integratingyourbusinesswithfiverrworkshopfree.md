This workshop is a hands-on experience where you can start building your presence on Fiverr in the best way from the start.

Each registrant will have the opportunity to reserve a 15-minute window to meet 1:1 with a Fiverr representative. You will not be required to stay for the entire duration of the event. We will follow up with a link to a spreadsheet to schedule time in advance.
