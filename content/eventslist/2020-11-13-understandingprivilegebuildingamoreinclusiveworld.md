Does the color “nude” match your skin tone? When you look through a history book do you see images of people that primarily look like you?

As a kid, could your family afford to pay for you to play a sport, join the drama club, have a private tutor or attend a non-public school?
Do the leaders (CEOs, Board Members, Founders) of the industry that you currently work in predominantly look like you?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, the simple fact is that yes, you have privilege.
In this webinar, we will address head on (with heart and humility, of course!) the topic of privilege. We will take a deep dive and answer the questions:

What is privilege?
How privileged am I, exactly?
What can I do about it?
