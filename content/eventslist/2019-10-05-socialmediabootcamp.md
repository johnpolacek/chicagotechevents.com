Are you effectively tapping into social media? This bootcamp introduces participants to the current social media landscape and explores how it can be used for maximum results (for brands as well as agencies). We'll dive into how to create, execute, measure and optimize your social media marketing strategy.

Participants will leave with a detailed understanding of both the current social media landscape and how to evaluate which tools or social platforms are the best fit for their organization's strategic goals. Case studies and tactics will be presented throughout the session and participants will gain hands on knowledge through breakout sessions.
