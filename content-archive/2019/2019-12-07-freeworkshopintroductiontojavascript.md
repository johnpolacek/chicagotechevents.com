JavaScript is what makes the web move. JavaScript is used to make apps, interactive websites, responsive animations, web games... pretty much whatever you can think up.

In this course, you will learn the basic concepts of JavaScript, learn to talk directly to your website, and create your own JavaScript program using Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools) or Launchbox!
