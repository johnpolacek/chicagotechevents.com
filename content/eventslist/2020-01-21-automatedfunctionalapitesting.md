We will cover - Defining an API test strategy - Creating an API testing suite that will mimic the UI data flow by request chaining endpoints - Integrating our API tests into our CI/CD pipeline. We will use two different, popular approaches: Postman with newman and BDD-style testing using C# and Specflow.
