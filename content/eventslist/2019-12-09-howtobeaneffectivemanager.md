Due to the fast pace of change today, many employees get thrust into managerial positions and immediately face numerous new challenges and responsibilities with little training. Ensuring that valuable individual contributors can adapt quickly into effective managers is critical to the long-term viability of every organization and is a fast track for an individual to pursue a more fulfilling career. In this workshop, you’ll get an in-depth look at the roles and responsibilities of a manager.
