TechTeam welcomes you to join us for our "Python for Data Analysis" workshop! In this workshop, we'll be using the Pandas library, applying the concepts of Series and DataFrame from that library, and gaining data cleaning practice through small exercises. A brief overview of Python basics will be covered at the beginning. And no need to download additional software, we will be working in Google Colab! This workshop will be held in the IOP basement's student workroom.
