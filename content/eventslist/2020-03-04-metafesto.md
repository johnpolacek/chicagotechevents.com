METAFESTOÂ is designed to introduce and educate local high school & college gamer enthusiasts to the world of Esports and to help support opportunities for students with autism. There will be a celebrity NBA2K tournament with students from local High School and Colleges, a mini boot camp for students to learn about the world of Esports and its opportunities, coding, art fair, and a Silent Disco Party to end the festivities. Chicago was the first city in the US to award college scholarships to Esports players. METAFESTO aims to build on this history by bringing awareness to help build the Chicago Esports community, share their Esports stories with other communities around the world via social media, and support all the great work the HollyRod Foundation does.
