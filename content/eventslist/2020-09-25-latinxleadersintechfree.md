Join us for inspiring talks from five Latinx changemakers who will share their career journeys, how they reached their level of success, and the hurdles they overcame along the way. They will also impart advice on how we can collectively create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace culture to encourage more Latinx leaders to enter and stay in tech fields.
