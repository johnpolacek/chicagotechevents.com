In todayâ€™s cut-throat business competition, it is important for organizations to keep evolving due to significant changes in customer behaviour, intensifying regulations and emerging technologies. Hence, creating and maintaining enterprise-level web systems is of great importance to adapt to digital disruption, drive innovation, improve customer centricity and gain long-term digital value.


Many enterprises are already developing a robust and maintainable user interface with JavaScript web frameworks due to their extensibility and stability. Modular front-end and backend frameworks with standalone architectures can provide the right development environment, libraries, widgets, plugins to build enterprise applications seamlessly.
