About This Class Series
SQL provides powerful but reasonably simple tools for data analysis and handling. This two-part series will take absolute beginners through the basics of SQL to an ability to write queries with confidence. We will use a combination of lecture and in-class exercises to ensure that participants leave with a working grasp of SQL fundamentals.
