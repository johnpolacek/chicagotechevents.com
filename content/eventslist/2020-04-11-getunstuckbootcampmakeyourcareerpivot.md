Have you been wanting to make a career pivot but unsure what you want to be doing, how to translate your past experiences, or where to even start? This robust career bootcamp will show you not just tactical job search techniques, but guide you through an exploratory day of learning to better understand yourself as a professional. Learn research based techniques to explore your values, interests, strengths, and skills and leverage these in your job search. Learn goal setting techniques and how to effectively “career map.” Finally, learn how to put this all together in a strategic job search and learn a framework for discussing and explaining your pivot to anyone. This interactive workshop includes 1:1 feedback and coaching with a professional coach.
