Students will work in teams to design a mobile app. They will select an app idea, develop a prototype, and present their final product to the class. This session will provide you with specific tools, techniques and workflows to help you kick-off your mobile app idea the right way. 

Join us to learn the latest strategies in brainstorming and develop your abilities to outline a project concept and present it for feedback to help you make informed design decisions. Learn techniques to help you communicate a concept, create low-fidelity wireframes, user flows, prototypes and to work within a team. So bring your pencils, crayons, markers, paper, post-it notes and smartphone (if you have one) and let the fun begin!
