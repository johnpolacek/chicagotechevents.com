Photoshop is the industry standard photo image editing software for print and digital output. In this hands-on introductory workshop, we will walk through Photoshop's basic capabilities and use tools and techniques to edit images and create visual design mock-ups - no design experience required!

This bootcamp will help students visualize products and designs using Photoshop and learn some basic visual design tips.

Participants should be familiar with the basic functions of their computer, such as launching programs, creating folders, copying and pasting objects, formatting text, finding and saving files.
