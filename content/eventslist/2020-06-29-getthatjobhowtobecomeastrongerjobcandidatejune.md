This two-hour workshop will whip you into shape to be ready to land an exciting new job. A certified career coach with Ama La Vida will guide you through a series of exercises to help you get noticed by employers, wow them in your interviews and prepare to kick butt on the job.

We will start by ensuring you are seeking the right job opportunities for you. We will utilize a framework to help you evaluate various job opportunities and identify those which are best aligned with what you're looking for and where you'll be both successful and fulfilled. We will then make sure you stand out, both on paper and digitally with a refresh of your resume and LinkedIn profile. Next we will talk about how you are applying and your system for tracking applications. We will prepare you for interviews with tips on how to research and some frameworks to help you crush those interview questions. Last we will prepare you to negotiate a killer compensation package and ensure you have everything you need to set goals and do great work in your first 90 days on the job.

By the end of the two hours, you will certainly be winded, but you will thank yourself for it later! You'll be all ready to go to hit the job market and land your dream job!
