In this intensive, two-day bootcamp participants will gain an understanding of the entire product development lifecycle, the role of UX in software development, modern requirement gathering techniques, fundamentals of software architecture and design and user testing practices.

Students will learn Lean UX approaches to help both designers and non-designers rapidly define stakeholder needs, design and test solutions and synthesize feedback to create competitive, user-centric product experiences.
