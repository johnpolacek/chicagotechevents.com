The tools that technologists build are often completely ignorant of queer experiences, or based on stereotypical assumptions about queer communities when they attempt to be inclusive. And more than that, the way we treat data about gender and sexuality can be downright dangerous for traditionally marginalized groups.

To create safe, empowering tech experiences for LGBT+ users, digital fields need to do much more than improve workplace culture and include new gender options in dropdown menus. During this talk, data scientist Soren Spicknall will discuss how industry-wide data practices lead to an undercount of queer individuals, and how the prospect of remedying this undercount could pose major dangers of its own. Queer lives can be deeply harmed by careless data treatment, and Soren will discuss those harms and the many options available to prevent them.

Formerly part of the Microsoft Cities Team and the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions, Soren is currently part of the founding team of AskWhai, a new company focused on providing ethical, explainable AI tools to small businesses.

Soran is a data scientist with a keen interest in the policy and social impact applications of the field. Civic technologist helping to leverage emerging technologies to confront problems of importance.
