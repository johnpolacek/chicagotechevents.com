Today, in the modern era, running a successful business revolves around the right use of technology. For several years, Salesforce has enabled small and medium-sized businesses to turn into larger companies by providing full-fledged services that help to gain a competitive advantage.

Unfortunately, as companies grow, they are sometimes unable to tap into the true potential of the Salesforce platform. Thus, many users realize they are missing out on advanced capabilities that can bring them better ROI.

Due to the extensible nature of the Salesforce platform, transformative technologies like IoT and AI can be integrated with Salesforce to achieve the next level of customer relationship management.
