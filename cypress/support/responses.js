By the convention’s end, that idea had blossomed into something all nerds have searched for, at one point or another, but that black fans have rarely been able to truly enjoy: a space where you can love what you love fiercely alongside people who look like you and share that passion — a place to belong.” - Devon Maloney at THE VERGE, 2018\n\"It's so weird going to a con and seeing so many people with… hair like you... Skin like you… Not giving you weird looks. I don't feel like an outsider. I need more of this.” - Mikki Kendall, Chicago Reader\n“Amazing! Just the feel of home. Something that was ours. Freeing! It was like a convention, block party, and cultural event all in one, but it was ours!” - Anonymous Attendee\n“I’m very appreciative of the people who took the risk to do this, and the people who put this together are leaders in our culture.” - Van Jones, CNN host and former advisor to President Obama\n\nWakandacon is the place to try something new.\nLast year, we cosplayed, learned how to pitch original TV & film ideas, and learned stunt choreography from a  Jabari warrior from the film!
