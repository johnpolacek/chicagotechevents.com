By Academy Award-winning directors’ Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, End Game premiered at Sundance last year and urges viewers to think about our last days on Earth not as a heartbreaking tragedy but as an opportunity for true closure.\nFollowing the screening, the documentary’s executive producer, Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider, will moderate a conversation with Julie Goldstein, chief of clinical ethics at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Ashish Shah, co-founder of Prepared Health, and Emelia Altschul, director of marketing at Vynca. The panelists will discuss how technology is being used today to help people experience the end of life in a way that matches their values and goals — and how it could and should be used in the future.\n\nAgenda:\n5:00pm | Networking5:30pm | Film6:15pm | Panel \n\n\nAbout the panelists\n\n\nDr. Shoshana Ungerleider  is redesigning what it means to live well to the very end. She is a physician, philanthropist and speaker. She works as an internist practicing hospital medicine at California Pacific Medical Center, serves on the Executive Board of the Foundation Board of Trustees and started the End Well Foundation. As someone passionate about improving how people are cared for throughout the continuum of life, Shoshana founded End Well Symposium, a first of its kind interdisciplinary event on design and innovation for the end of life experience.\n\n\n\n\nJulie Goldstein is an ethicist, internist and palliative care physician. She has been chief of Clinical Ethics at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center since 1996. In 2005, she helped establish the hospital’s palliative care consultation services and was medical director there until 2014. She is a Respecting Choices First Steps  Instructor, certified Next Steps Organizational Faculty for Advocate Health Care and certified Advanced Steps State Faculty for Illinois, and she served in 2018 on the Respecting Choices MD Online Curriculum Advisory Group. Dr.Goldstein was founding president of the Chicago End-of-Life Care Coalition starting in 2000, and was on its board through 2013. She participated in the ISMS introduction of ACP cpt billing codes to the AMA’s CPT Editorial board; the codes have been reimbursed by Medicare since 2015. Since 2000, she had worked on the improvement of the IDPH out-of-hospital emergency order form, and since 2009 has chaired the POLST Illinois Task Force. In 2016, POLST Illinois became a committee of the Illinois Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, on whose board she is a member. With the POLST Illinois program she has collaborated with multiple statewide organizations to develop the form and create statewide POLST educational resources.\n\n\n\nAshish V. Shah is the co-founder and CEO of Prepared Health, a Chicago-based healthcare technology company that helps healthcare providers communicate with one another around the care of their patients. The Prepared Health network connects hospitals, outpatient, post-acute, home and community-based care providers in real-time to improve patient outcomes. The connected platform includes DINA, an AI technology that analyzes patient data and suggests evidence-based interventions to caregivers. The network also can be used as a tool to engage and coach caregivers at every level so they are better equipped to deliver care. Previously, Shah was the CTO at Medicity, a subsidiary of Aetna.\n\n\n\nEmelia Altschul has more than 10 years of healthcare marketing, sales and channel experience. Emelia is currently the director of marketing at Vynca, an advance care planning company. Before Vynca, Emelia led the channel and partnership program at PointRight, a post-acute analytics company. Prior to that, she spent a number of years at Allscripts, leading marketing for ambulatory solutions and professional services, and was also a client sales executive on the national accounts team. Emelia received her BA from Denison University, and an MBA from Northeastern University with a concentration in marketing.\n\nThis event is a part of our Healthy Aging Immersion series:\nIncreased life expectancy, the emergence of alternative care sites and a more active and engaged elderly population are causing disruptive shifts in the technologies, experiences and business models of stakeholders serving this population, making healthy aging an important area for research and innovation.

It's free to attend, but make sure you grab a ticket here first!\nAt 4:00 PM, we will host a tech class called Basic Espresso Tech. This class will focus on what goes on under the hood of an espresso machine and will cover basic maintenance and operation.\nAt 5:00 PM, we will dig into what is actually happening during extraction with Espresso Theory. We will look at how temperature and flow rate can affect extraction and offer tools to diagnose and address issues.\nAt 6:00 PM, Boss Barista will start a live podcast focused on how baristas can advocate for themselves in their workplaces.\nAt 7:00 PM, we will start the Technical Throwdown. This is our take on a Latte Art Throwdown but with more of a focus on elements that are important behind the bar. There will be 4 rounds, with each focusing on a different aspect of drink preparation.\nIf you want to compete in the Technical Throwdown, signups will start here on Monday, June 3 at 7 PM CST. Set an alarm if you want to compete! We will fill 12 online and 4 the day of the competition for a total of 16 spots. Competitors that register online must check in before 6 PM on the day of the competiton. The unfilled brackets will be filled lottery-style at 6 PM.\nHere are the rules for the Technical Throwdown:\n\n\nRound 1: Dial in Challenge. This is a head to head, single elimination espresso skills round. Competitors will each have 5 minutes to dial in and serve 3 espressos as fast as possible. The fastest heat winner will win a prize. Espresso will be judged on sweetness, balance, acidity and body.\n\n\nRound 2: Technical Pours. This will flow like a typical latte art throwdown, but a tech judge will score baristas on bar etiquette. Competitors will lose a point if they don’t wipe and purge the steam wand, if they don’t empty the espresso puck, if the cup served is not clean (any spills on cup), if they touch the rim when serving, and if they leave a spill or a mess.\n\n\nRound 3: Difficulty Pours. For every point that a barista was docked in the previous round, they will have to choose from a list of difficulty modifiers: Pour into a to-go cup, pour using a bad pitcher, pour into a 60 gram espresso yield, steam using 30% power, or pour with a non-dominant hand.\n\n\nFinal Round: Host Rules.\n\n\nPlease note that everyone present at the event, including volunteers, attendees and competitors are subject to our Code of Conduct, available here.","html":"<P><SPAN>We are excited to kick off the Ramp Up road tour in Chicago with Groundswell!</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>Ramp Up is a barista-focused road tour that seeks to empower baristas by offering free, professional classes and by elevating drink making with a fun, skills-based competition: the Technical Throwdown.
