Are you just beginning to code or want to start but are afraid it will be too challenging? Well, we encourage you to get out there and dive right in because ‘YOU Can Code!” In this workshop, students will use Blockly, a drag and drop language to interface with the memory of the computer. We will be trying a number of puzzles, mazes and games to explore sequential events, selection and repetition.
