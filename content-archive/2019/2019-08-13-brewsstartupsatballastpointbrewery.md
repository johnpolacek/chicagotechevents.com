The rooftop at Ballast Point is one of the best-kept-secrets of the West Loop. Join us at their Starboard Sundeck to network with like-minded innovators and entrepreneurs on August 12th.

Expand your craft beer knowledge and taste buds this summer while making new connections with other innovative Brews+Starters.

Go on a private tour to understand why they have over 300 quality checkpoints from grain to glass to ensure the best brews.

Join Brews+Startups to experience how Ballast Point dedicates itself to the craft to brewing beers right in the West Loop.
