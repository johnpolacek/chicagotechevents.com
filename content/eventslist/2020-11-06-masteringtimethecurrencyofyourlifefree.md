Join Laurie Gerber, Head Coach of Handel Group Life Coaching, for a deep dive into mastering time. Creating a whole new approach to time management requires taking an honest look at your current relationship to time. Often, we have no idea how many things we are actually responsible for or intending to do each day, and no idea what we actually do with our time. Yikes! In this talk, Laurie will teach you how to hack into your own relationship to time and get conscious of the patterns and excuses that are currently keeping you stuck.
