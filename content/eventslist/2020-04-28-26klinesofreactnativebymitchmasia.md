This month, Mitch Masia will walk us through the decisions he made while greenfielding a new React Native app. This talk isn't about "best-practices", theory, or scale - we're going to dig into the decisions an actual developer made to be productive. We'll cover code organization, state management (GraphQL w/ Apollo), custom hooks, styling, testing, deployment, and some surface-level backend stuff!
