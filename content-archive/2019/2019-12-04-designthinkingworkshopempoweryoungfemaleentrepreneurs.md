Apply real design thinking techniques to help YEA Chicago expand its yearly young women participants from 20 to 100 in 2020. Participants will be broken into teams, walked through design thinking activities, and present solutions at the end of the event. Winning teams of the friendly competition will be invited to take a tour of mHub, Chicagoâ€™s physical product accelerator, with the founder of Casecomps.
