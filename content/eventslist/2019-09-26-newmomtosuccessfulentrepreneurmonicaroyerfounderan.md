After the birth of her daughter, new mom Monica Royer wanted to know the clothing touching her daughter’s skin came from the most trustworthy fabrics available. When she couldn’t easily find those products, she decided to make them herself. Her experience advising with her brother, Andy Dunn, Founder of Bonobos, combined with her passion for fashion and dresses inspired her to build Monica + Andy.
