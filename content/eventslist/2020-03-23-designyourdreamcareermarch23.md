In this workshop, you will get a brief introduction to future visioning and project design (the methodology we will use to learn and create in the class) and an overview of the basic steps to take to transform your career. Youâ€™ll then roll up your sleeves, design a model of your ideal career, explore the impact of maintaining your career status quo, and create concrete action steps to get you moving as soon as you leave the classroom.

Take a break from the 100-hour workweeks, meaningless Excel models and office politics, and explore the possibility of a career and life lived on your own terms.
