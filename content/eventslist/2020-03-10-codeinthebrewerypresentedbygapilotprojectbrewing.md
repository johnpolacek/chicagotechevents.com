Pilot Project Brewing and General Assembly are joining forces to bring an interactive evening of code and beer to the Chicago community!

In this two-hour, hands-on coding 101 crash course - youâ€™ll discover the basics of coding using HTML and CSS.

Whether you are brand new to tech, starting to dip your toes into code, or just curious about the intersection of tech and our daily lives, Code in the Brewery will inspire you to jumpstart your journey and never stop learning.

Capacity is limited so admission will be first come, first served. Please RSVP.
