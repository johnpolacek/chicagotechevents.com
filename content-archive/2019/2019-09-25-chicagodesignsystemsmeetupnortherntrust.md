How does a 130-year-old bank create, support and scale a design system?

Members of Northern Trust's product design and UI services team will provide a look into their multi-year journey to build a design system for their client-facing digital experiences. You'll learn about the ecosystem of visual and technical resources and tooling they use today, as well as how they grew support and use of the system through educational resources and more.
