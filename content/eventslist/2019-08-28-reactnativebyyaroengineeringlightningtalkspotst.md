How has React Native accelerated white label application development? Distributed features and applications often means re-work and duplicate projects, but by leveraging Reactâ€™s core features we can streamline development and implementation. Using rapid feedback and development along with configuration, you can quickly iterate on features to optimize them for multiple sets of clients & users. Join the Yaro Product / Engineering team as we talk about how user testing influences our feature development, and how we use React to rapidly deliver these digital experiences.
