Join Flatiron School for a beginner's workshop where we will dive into using Flutter to develop Mobile Applications from the ground up! We will discuss what a Widget is in Flutter and how to manage state in Flutter applications.

You are not required to know Flutter, but there will be a couple of items to download and install before the workshop.
