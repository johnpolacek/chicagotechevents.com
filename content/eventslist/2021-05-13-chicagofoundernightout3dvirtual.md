Founder Night Out is a fun, social event where you can meet entrepreneurs, investors, service providers, and other members of the startup community. You can also share your business ideas and aspirations with like-minded peers. All you need is a web browser to attend.

The online event will feature an interactive 3D environment where you can control your avatar to explore the venue, network with participants, and exchange contact info from the comfort of your home. Also, we will have a Startup Showcase in which pre-selected startups will pitch their companies and engage in Q&A.
