Are you using Excel for analysis? Spreadsheets are useful for analyzing and visualizing data, but become cumbersome and unwieldy with large datasets.

Relational databases address many of Excel's limitations by simplify repetitive tasks and enabling analysis over much larger datasets. The only catch is that you need to know SQL to fully harness the power of these technologies.

This class will introduce participants to the world of databases and analysis in SQL. Participants will be shown how to setup a SQL environment on their laptops, so that they can practice writing queries on a real dataset. After this class, participants will understand the fundamentals of SQL syntax, and be able to write queries using PGAdmin (one of the world's most popular database design tools).
