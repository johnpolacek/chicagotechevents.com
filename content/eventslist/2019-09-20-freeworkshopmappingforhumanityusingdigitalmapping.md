Maps help us understand the visual picture of the world. But has the entire world been mapped? Satellites capture images of the earth and scientists are researching the best ways to convert these images into meaningful information. One of the most direct ways to recognize ?features? from a satellite image is with the human eye.

In this workshop, students will learn how satellite images, collected by various agencies around the world, can be used to help global humanity. Platforms like OpenStreetMap and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Tasking Manager offer an opportunity for volunteers, (such as the participants at TechGirlz) who are not necessarily experts in coding or interpreting this information, to contribute to critical missions. NGOs like the American Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders will use the maps we make during the workshop to plan relief and aid efforts around the world.

Students will have the opportunity to visit some of the locations they will be mapping on Saturday the 21st between 3:30 to 5:30 pm
