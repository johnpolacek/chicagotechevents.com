Preparation
This workshop is for beginners, no coding experience required, if you know how to create a folder and open a document, you know enough to take this class! Basic HTML experience may be helpful, but is not necessary.

Bring along a laptop and please install the following free software before class: Sublime Text 2 http://www.sublimetext.com/2 Google Chrome https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/
