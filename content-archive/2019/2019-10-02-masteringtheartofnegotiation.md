From working with business partners and job candidates, to navigating your own compensation or buying a home or car, negotiation is a critical skill in our everyday lives.

Become a master of negotiation in this program - learn how to identify negotiation opportunities, prepare for various situations, and achieve not just your desired result but learn how to drive to a mutually beneficial result for all parties.

Using proven strategies from the Harvard Negotiation Project, this workshop will offer an overview of the theory and tactics of negotiations, a discussion of ways to manage the emotional dimensions of conflict resolution, and expose students to several key tools of awareness to approach negotiations to seek optimal, mutually agreeable outcomes.
