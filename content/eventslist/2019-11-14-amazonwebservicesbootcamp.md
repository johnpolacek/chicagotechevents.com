Amazon Web Services is hosting a series of workshops that illustrate the variety of ways AWS can support you on your journey as a founder and a startup. Session 1 and Session 2 will provide you with base level best practices and address some of the most common questions when launching on AWS. Dinner will be served afterwards at 5:30 pm, which will be followed by Session 3, a hands-on workshop on building a serverless web application.
