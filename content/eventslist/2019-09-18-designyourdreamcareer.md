About This Workshop
It's February, which means that the buzz and promise of the New Year has probably worn off by now. As you settle into 2019, you remember how much you dislike your current job. How every day feels like an uphill battle and no weekend ever feels long enough. Don’t wait ‘til next year to make moves. Seize this chance to design your ideal career now!

In this workshop, you will get a brief introduction to future visioning and project design (the methodology we will use to learn and create in the class) and an overview of the basic steps to take to transform your career. You’ll then roll up your sleeves, design a model of your ideal career, explore the impact of maintaining your career status quo, and create concrete action steps to get you moving as soon as you leave the classroom.

Take a break from the 100-hour workweeks, meaningless Excel models and office politics, and explore the possibility of a career and life lived on your own terms.

Takeaways
Greater clarity about the kind of life / career you should build for yourself.
Initial understanding of the impact of not building your ideal life.
That your assumptions about what is keeping you from moving toward your ideal career are simply assumptions.
Concrete actions to move toward a career that doesn’t feel like work.
Preparation
Some exposure to coaching, future visioning, and design thinking would be great, but is definitely not required. Also, a willingness to explore your potential, and a sense of humor.
