Overview:
Becoming accredited is a verification of the laboratory's capability of producing reliable results in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025. Accreditation is not a guarantee of analytical competency. Getting accredited is just the beginning. The journey begins with defining the laboratory's operating principals and policies.

It continues with describing the procedures that will be implemented to address these policies and it will conclude with the evidence that staff are complying with these requirements on a continuous basis. Ensuring continuous compliance requires oversight, monitoring and evidence and is part of the journey as the laboratory strives to achieve analytical perfection. Maintaining the laboratory's accreditation status is everyone's responsibility.

Why you should Attend: Many laboratories struggle with developing and implementing a functional quality management system that not only complies with the management and technical requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2005 but also meets their needs. Once accreditation has been achieved many laboratories have difficulty maintaining the QMS as evidenced by the number of non-conformances cited during the subsequent biannual audits. Why do you want to become accredited? Where do you start? For laboratories that are already accredited, how do you ensure staff adherence and ongoing compliance to minimize corrective actions arising from accreditation audits? Getting there is relatively easy. Staying there is hard part.
