Queer Tech Club will return to ShopRunner, a Chicago-based tech company connecting customers to popular brands through a growing marketplace and a members-only service that provides benefits across more than 140 online stores. Like all of the Queer Tech Club events, attendees will have the opportunity to network with other local LGBTQ tech pros over food and drinks before hearing announcements from our members and ShopRunner.
