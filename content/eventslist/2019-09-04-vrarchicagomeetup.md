VR/AR Chicago brings together people who are interested in working with virtual and augmented reality technology.The group includes developers, business leaders, investors, students, and more. Many of our members are actively working with VR and AR technology here in Chicago - providing consulting, business development, and technology development services. What makes us different from other groups is that we are not just interested in seeing what's out there, we are actively producing, promoting, and demonstrating VR and AR technology in our businesses and community.
