In 2017, every 7th grader in the UK was given a tiny programmable computer to help them learn coding. So what is this small, affordable technology called? A micro:bit!


In this workshop, students will use the micro:bitâ€™s drag and drop interface, MakeCode, to learn how to code the device. Students will walk through the various features of a micro:bit and learn how the code they create can activate animation, temperature sensing, radio buttons and motion sensors. Students will also design and make their own animated bracelet.
