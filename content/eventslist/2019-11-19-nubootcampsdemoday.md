Network with other local tech industry professionals and engage with new tech talent from the NU Boot Camps Demo Day. Students are set up around the room 'expo style' to showcase web applications that they've developed during the program and receive feedback from the industry professionals in attendance. It's a great opportunity to mentor and mingle with those in the tech community.
