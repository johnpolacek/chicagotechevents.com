Looking for data scientists to join your team? Interested in previewing work from up and comers in the field? General Assembly welcomes you to discover the skills and talents of our incredible graduates from the most recent GA data science immersive program.

Join us virtually for a lunchtime seminar on May 1, where our data science candidates will deliver lightning round presentations on their latest work, followed by Q&A from the audience.

GA data science graduates have diverse backgrounds and are eager to showcase their skills. At this online event, presenters will discuss projects that use neural networks, explore social listening, and predict financial market trends with NLP (natural language processing).

Most of our graduates are looking for junior- to mid-level, full-time roles aligned with the skills they mastered at GA. Some are interested in learning about contract, freelance, and internship opportunities to help expand their experience in the data science world.

There is no fee associated with the event. Bring a friend, a colleague or two!

This event is hosted completely online via Zoom. We will email the webinar link 24 hours prior to the event.

You will need access to a laptop or computer with a working webcam and microphone as well as a strong internet connection.
