In this full day track, you'll learn the key features of Zendesk Support including User roles and permissions, Views, Macros, Triggers, Automations, SLAs, Ticket and User fields. Equally important you'll also learn how to configure them and use them in combination so that you meet your business goals--whether you're a small organization or a large enterprise. The sessions will consist of presentations, hands-on exercises, breakout groups and teamwork, plus plenty of time for Q&A so that you get your most pressing questions answered. And you'll walk away a lot more confident about how you should set up (or clean up) your Zendesk Support.
