"Are you struggling with paint color but don’t know where to start? If you love to paint portraits, draw characters or create fantasy environments, painting digitally is a lot of fun. But for most digital artists and those who are learning to paint, color is challenging, intimidating and one of the most difficult subjects to learn.

We will be performing series of workshops to help you start learning color to improve your color.
To begin the color journey, we’ll first study the most important building block of color: value and composition.

Some of our topics include: 
- Color and Composition exercise (We will cover a fun and powerful exercise to help you start painting in color the right way).
- Monochrome film studies


Our workshops are designed for those who want to start painting in color with confidence and get consistent results."
