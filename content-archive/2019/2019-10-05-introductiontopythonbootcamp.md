Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language with many applications. This workshop explores Python's place in the scientific ecosystem, and how the language, with several readily-available open-source libraries, can serve as a powerful tool for data analysis. Designed as a stand-alone introduction to the data science aspects of Python, this class is also a recommended refresher for participants planning to enroll in General Assembly's upcoming Data Science workshop. The workshop is hands-on and exercise based, so participants will get plenty of practice.
