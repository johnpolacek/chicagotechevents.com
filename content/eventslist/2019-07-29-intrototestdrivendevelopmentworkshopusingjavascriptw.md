Introduction to TDD AbstractTest driven development is a great skill to learn if youâ€™re interested in learning how to test your code thoroughly. Plenty of tech companies are also taking this skill into consideration when hiring developers as well. Having good tests in your codebase can help in preventing bugs, finding bugs, refactoring your code and providing good documentation for what your code does. In this workshop, you will learn how to write tests using Javascript and the Jest testing framework. You will also learn about the fundamentals of test driven development. You will write your tests and build out a coding exercise or two in the process. You will learn how to write good unit tests and why having good tests in your codebase is important. PrerequisitesYou should have experience with coding. This can be experience from working on small personal projects, open source projects or professional development experience. Some experience in coding with Javascript is suggested but not a requirement. You should have some experience using the command line.
