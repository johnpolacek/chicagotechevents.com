Scrum is used extensively, but not exclusively, in web and software development. Everyone from developers to business execs are now expected to know how to work using Scrum, but few are taught it and many struggle along with misinformed ideas. This bootcamp will cover the main principles and ideas underpinning agile and why using Scrum is the best way to run certain projects. Through games, hands-on practice and project simulations, youâ€™ll be armed with the knowledge of how to use Scrum on a day-to-day basis.
