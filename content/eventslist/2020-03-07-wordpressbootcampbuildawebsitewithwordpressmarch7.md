WordPress is awesome but often misunderstood. Is it a blogging platform? A CMS? Should you buy a custom theme or develop your own? WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org?

In this course, you’ll develop a custom site starting from scratch. Basically, you’ll take a static front-end HTML/CSS template and do all the necessary magic to have that site running live and dynamic using WordPress.

Afterward, your clients will be able to edit content themselves, manage the site’s navigation, and leverage an array of existing plug-ins that will help take the site from a simple blog to a fully functional CMS. All customizable; all on WordPress.
