IT Owner's Compass is an IT business event like no other. Not only are we computer business owners ourselves, but we have listened to your feedback from past events and aim to make this the most informative, useful, and social event for IT owners. If you could wave a magic wand and create the perfect event to help you grow your business, our goal is to make IT Owner's Compass that event.  Focused on small break-out group settings, you'll work with your peers on the topics that you chose.  Hands-on featured demos of new products and the ones you use every day!
