Git, a distributed version control system, is a fundamental tool in modern software development, allowing teams to effectively track and manage changes to projects over time.
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. With over 28 million users and more than 57 million repositories, it is the largest host of source code in the world and has become the place to be if you want to collaborate with other designers and developers on open-source projects. In this introductory workshop, you'll learn about the purpose of version control (specifically Git and GitHub), the history and importance of GitHub in the development community, the fundamental concepts of Git, and basic use cases and commands.
