HTML and CSS are the fundamental building blocks of the web. Whether you're a beginner who wants to get started in web development, a designer looking to hand-code their concepts, or a marketer who wants a little more control over their CMS, you'll need to know HTML and CSS to get the job done.

This session, designed for the beginner programmer, will assume no previous coding knowledge. We'll go over key coding terminology and principles, introduce languages like HTML and CSS—what their functions are, how they work together—and use that new knowledge to write our own code and develop our own simple site.
