In celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, we invite you to join us for this interactive breakfast about how Latinas are succeeding in tech and fostering the next generation of leaders in Chicago.

The breakfast will feature lightning talks by a handful of amazing women in the Chicago tech scene and take a deeper dive into the issues they face in their respective industries and solutions to how to rise above the obstacles and thrive in their growing fields.
