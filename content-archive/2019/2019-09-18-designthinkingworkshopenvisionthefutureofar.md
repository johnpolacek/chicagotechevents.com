Apply real design thinking techniques to help MW Immersive, an 1871 startup focused on building virtual and augmented reality solutions, identify how it's futuristic technology could be applied to large retailers (think Target, Walmart, etc). Participants will be broken into teams, walked through design thinking activities, and present solutions at the end of the event. Winning teams of the friendly competition will receive tours of mHub, Chicagoâ€™s physical product accelerator.
