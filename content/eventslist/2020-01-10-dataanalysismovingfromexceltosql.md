Are you using Excel for analysis? Spreadsheets are useful for analyzing and visualizing data, but become cumbersome and unwieldy with large datasets.

Relational databases address many of Excel's limitations by simplify repetitive tasks and enabling analysis over much larger datasets. The only catch is that you need to know SQL to fully harness the power of these technologies.
