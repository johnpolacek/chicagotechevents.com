This free workshop is for middle school girls, grades 6-8.

Think coding is hard? Everyone can code. Join us at the workshop to get started. We use Blockly, a drag and drop language to instruct the computer. We will be trying a number of puzzles, mazes and games to explore sequential events, selection and repetition. After, students will be able to access the web pages at home to continue their learning.
