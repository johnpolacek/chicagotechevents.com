Want to start your own podcast, but not sure how? This five hour bootcamp (plus a break for lunch) will take you through the process of podcast production, promotion, and more!

First, the Podcast Production workshop brings you through the process of recording, editing, producing, and publishing your podcast. The workshop also covers hardware, software, apps, and web services for podcast recording, editing, publishing, and more. No prior podcasting experience is required!

Then, we'll examine ten strategies for marketing and promoting your podcast! From the role of visuals in an audio medium, to best web platforms, to social and digital platforms for podcasts, and more.

Each attendee will leave with the knowledge necessary to launch their own podcast, and the tools and strategies necessary to grow your listenership and engage with your audience
