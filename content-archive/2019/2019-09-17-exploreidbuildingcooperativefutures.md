As partners on projects like 51 Futures and Act Calumet, ID students and faculty activate new ways for communities to come together and build understanding. Through true collaboration, we help identify opportunities and possibilities, making them tangible so we can all consider their effects, both now and over time. In this event, weâ€™ll share our process of experimentation, how we discover, iterate, and refine, and how we move from ideas to action.
