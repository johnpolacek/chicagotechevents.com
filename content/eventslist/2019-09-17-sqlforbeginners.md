About This Class
Looking to learn some basic SQL skills to filter, aggregate or produce reports from a database? Exporting data and using Excel instead of taking advantage of functionality your database already gives you? This class will give you the skills required to perform both basic and complex data manipulations with ease.

This class will introduce students to SQL queries for data gathering and data analysis. We will cover enough query syntax and examples and hands on practice to get students started on querying a database and performing common data analysis tasks that are transferable to their own needs.

Takeaways
Learn to write basic SQL queries to filter, aggregate and summarise data.

Know how to apply your new knowledge to many real life situations requiring SQL.

Understand underlying concepts through examples and hands on practice.

Have access to cloud based learning databases to support their learning after the course.

Preparation
We will be pausing to let students run and write queries of their own, using a database we will set set up in advance. Students should bring laptops with an up-do-date web browser to complete the classroom activities, no additional software will be needed.
