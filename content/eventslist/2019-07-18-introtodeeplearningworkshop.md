Join us for a free and interactive workshop where we'll study Deep Learning for Image Classification. 

In the last 10 years, Deep Learning has greatly improved the field of computer vision. In this workshop, we will learn about several different cutting-edge algorithms in this space and study how they work. This workshop is interactive--we'll play PAC-MAN using our face as a controller, get our hands dirty building an image classifier, and learn how we can leverage preexisting, state-of-the-art open source computer vision models to level up our own projects like the pros do!
