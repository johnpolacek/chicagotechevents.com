This workshop is perfect for those who have used web components before, or those who want to learn them from the ground up. Web components are a set of browser APIs that provide building blocks for creating reusable components that can be used with any framework, or in plain HTML. You can use them to build dropdowns, tooltips, modals, or even bus trackers!
