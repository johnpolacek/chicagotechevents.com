APIs are touching every facet of our society and the underlying trends are going to generate nearly 1 billion APIs in the coming years. All digital transformation is now API-driven and integration technologies underpin their evolution. Ultimately, all development projects will become integration projects.

Yet integration projects still follow a tool-based, waterfall approach. We believe that integration needs to follow an agile model to deal with the growing diversity of endpoints, protocols, and data formats. An integration agile approach rapidly adapts to these changes and requirements.

WSO2 API Day, co-presented with Quinnox, will delve into the concept of integration agile, the growth of APIs, and how you can integrate a world of disaggregated APIs, cloud services, and data. You will also learn how you can build an agile enterprise using our cell based reference architecture.
