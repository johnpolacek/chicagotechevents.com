Our classic course on applied psychology covers 50 behavior change principles, psychological design patterns and the essential skills in translating psychology into creative technology. 

Course 2: Emotional Design Psychology and Neuroscience
This class approaches interactive design from a neuroscientific perspective. It covers the foundations of user cognition, perception and emotion with a focus on the motivational system that drives online behavior.
