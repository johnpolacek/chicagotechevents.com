Did you know that Disney, Netflix, Google and NASA, just to name a few, are all using Python? Python can be used for creating web applications, automation, programming robots and artificial intelligence. Python is the language of choice from beginners to experts.

Students will learn how to program using Python starting with simple data types, including numbers, letters and strings, and lists. Students will also explore comparisons, if-statements, and loops. Finally, students will use what they learned to create their own game.
