Labs+Startups is hosting another corporate innovator Meetup with Caterpillar's Research Lab and the UIC Innovation Center.

Come learn about their joint approach to design and innovation, share thoughts and learnings among the group, and build relationships with other corporate innovators from the Midwest.

Contact us via Meetup to get the event registration information.

This is a no-selling, unsponsored event for corporate innovation professionals only. Itâ€™s a no pressure gathering and safe space to discuss ideas and build relationships. Labs+Startups is an all-volunteer, not for profit run by corporate innovation professionals in the Chicagoland area and all fees go to offset the cost of the event and cover the minimal overhead of the Labs+Startups organization.

Previous innovation/centers of excellence that have been featured include:

Allstate
Anheuser-Busch
Boeing
Dow
Kimberly-Clark
Kraft Heinz
Northern Trust
Relish Works
RGAx

Contact us via Meetup -- we look forward to meeting you on the 30th.

The Labs+Startups Team,

Hugh, J.P., Yamuna, Jessica, Bill, and Maritza
