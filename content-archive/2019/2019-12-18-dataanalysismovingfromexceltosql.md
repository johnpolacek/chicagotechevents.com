This class will introduce participants to the world of databases and analysis in SQL. Participants will be shown how to setup a SQL environment on their laptops, so that they can practice writing queries on a real dataset. After this class, participants will understand the fundamentals of SQL syntax, and be able to write queries using PGAdmin (one of the world's most popular database design tools).
