Chicago Founders' Stories, the cornerstone program of our Chicago Founders' TV series, showcases conversations with the most interesting and accomplished founders in Chicago. We tape the series before a live audience at 1871 over pizza and beer.

Each episode features a new Chicago founder. Creator and host Pat Ryan hears their true story, and explores it as only two founders having a conversation together can. We examine topics like where the idea came from, their background in entrepreneurship and technology, achieving product/market fit, getting liquidity, two-sided networks, raising venture capital, scaling, and more.

In December, we're sitting down with Godard Abel of G2.com , Inc.
