This will be your opportunity to meet fellow coders within the Chicago community for a night of food, coding and learning. Get to know our instructors, coaches and students who will be available to provide one-on-one support.

**This event is designed for anyone who is interested in applying to Flatiron School OR has already applied and is prepping for a technical interview.**

We recommend our FREE Software Engineering Bootcamp Prep Course but feel free to work on anything tech related! Click the link below to get started on our bootcamp prep course.

Have a friend who is working through Flatiron School's programs? Bring them along! You bring your laptop (and a friend!) and we'll provide the mediterranean fare!
