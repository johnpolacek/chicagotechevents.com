WordPress is the premier content management system for those seeking an easy, user-friendly way to set up and maintain a website. In this class, you’ll walk through the basics of getting your site live quickly and discover various free templates as well as premium resources that require little to no coding skills and will have your site looking polished and professional. Once your site has gone live, you’ll learn how to update and maintain it using the WordPress dashboard, as well as common problems and pitfalls to avoid. Plus you’ll find out how to customize your site to get the exact look you’re going for.

This is a beginner to intermediate workshop which is designed to be helpful to those who have never seen WordPress before or those who have been using WordPress but without a formal understanding of the mechanics behind it. Some basic knowledge of navigating websites is the only prerequisite.
