Our topic for this year's Fall Exchange is Leadership! It is an opportunity to explore our viewpoints on what is leadership, and more precisely, what it takes to lead. Innovative Female Empowerment - Rethink Leadership. Hear from Liem Le, an entrepreneur who wants us to reimagine social innovation and employee & community engagement, and alumni Laura Kempf, author of Inspiring Bold and Champion for leadership change. Relax with fellow Booth women for a fun evening at the Fall Exchange! Enjoy scintillating conversation, share laughter, strengthen old bonds and make new connections at this informal gathering in your hometown. All Booth women are welcome. Come by yourself or bring a friend along. Hope to see you there.
