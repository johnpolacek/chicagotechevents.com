We here at General Assembly are so proud, (but not surprised) that our graduates decided to put their software and design skills to work right away in order to alleviate the burdens that the current global difficulties have placed on so many people. A cross-functional team of User Experience Design, Data Science, and Software Engineering graduates have created digital product solutions in an attempt to do good for our world. We are delighted to support them here at General Assembly and in this spirit we would like to invite you all to experience the product reveal and interact with our talented graduates!
