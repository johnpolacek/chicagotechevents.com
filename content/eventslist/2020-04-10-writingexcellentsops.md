Overview:
Almost every paragraph of the Quality System Regulation states that manufacturers shall "establish" procedures. Well written SOPs that are easy to understand and follow are necessary to accomplish that objective. Excellent SOPs need more than just subject matter.

This webinar will help you to write complete, clear, unambiguous, and flexible SOPs. You will learn techniques for creating concise and easy to read SOPs that your employees can understand and will follow. Well written SOPs result in more consistent process outputs and quality results.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are a critical ingredient in an effective and efficient Quality Management System. SOPs are typically one of the first things an investigator asks for in an inspection. Well written SOPs send a message to the FDA and Notified Bodies that your QMS is complete, accurate, and followed.

More importantly, well written SOPs ensure that your personnel can consistently and accurately follow your processes resulting in correct outcomes, quality work, and predictable results.

Why you should Attend: "Inadequate SOP" observations still rank among the most frequently cited 483 and Warning Letter observations. SOPs are one of the first things an auditor/ investigator will review during and inspection.

Most importantly, poorly written procedures make it difficult for your employees to understand and consistently follow procedures. This can lead to disastrous consequences including quality problems and even recalls.Poorly written SOPs can and do impact your business.
