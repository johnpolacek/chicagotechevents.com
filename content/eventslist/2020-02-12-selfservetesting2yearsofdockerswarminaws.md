With teams being expected to deliver new features faster than ever before, the importance of rapid on-demand testing has only become more important. Similarly, as teams grow, it becomes critical to have a scalable system through which developers can deploy production-like environments for a multitude of different services. Over the past two years ReviewTrackers has grown from using a static-environment development pipeline to a highly scalable set of tools allowing deployment of ephemeral environments for QA and CI/CD purposes. This has enabled us to maintain a rapid pace of development involving multiple deploys per day, a rapid development feedback loop, and fast onboarding for new developers.
