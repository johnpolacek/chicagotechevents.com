When Robin Weis found out in 2014 that she had unknowingly been part of a year-long affair, she turned to data visualization to help her understand the gnarled mess of confusion, duplicity, and betrayal, and show objectively how "just a few lies" violated the entirety of the connection she thought they had shared. Equipped with a collaborative spreadsheet-record of conversations they had together, Robin created an interactive, quantitative illustration of the important components of their relationship and the ways they were each impacted by different types of deception. This case study will explore the operationalization of highly qualitative data, the visualization process (involving Illustrator and front-end dev), and the things Robin learned about authenticity, intimacy, and connection.
