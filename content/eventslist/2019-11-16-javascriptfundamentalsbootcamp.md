This one-day bootcamp is geared towards beginners with little or no prior experience and provides a full introduction to programming fundamentals using JavaScript. You will be introduced to some of the tools that will help you approach programming in a systematic way including flow charts and pseudo-code. Building on that foundation we will use JavaScript, the language of the web, to play with all of the basic structures of most modern programming languages including data types, flow of control, functions and objects. We will also cover how JavaScript as a language relates to other modern programming languages (such as HTML and CSS) and how it fits into the overall structure of the world wide web.
