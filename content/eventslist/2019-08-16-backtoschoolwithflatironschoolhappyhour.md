Head Back to School with Flatiron School!

About this Event:

Are you curious about coding but not sure where to begin? Kick off the weekend with Flatiron School at our community happy hour. Meet our students, alumni and instructors and hear first-hand how they are changing the future.

You'll have the opportunity to tour our campus and learn more about how we can help you change your life starting with a career in software engineering, data science or UX/UI design.
