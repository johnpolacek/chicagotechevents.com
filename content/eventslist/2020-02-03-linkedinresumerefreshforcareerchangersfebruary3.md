About This Class | 
A strategically targeted resume is your most important weapon when searching for a job. This document is often the first impression that you will make with an employer. On average, employers initially look at resumes for 10–20 seconds, so you've got to knock 'em out with a great document. Students will leave this workshop knowing just how to do that.

LinkedIn is the world’s professional social network and a vital resource to find business opportunities and form strategic alliances. We will explore LinkedIn’s unique feature-set and delve deep into the tools and techniques that will help you master LinkedIn. We will also walk through real examples of successful LinkedIn user profiles and learn the techniques to achieve an all-star profile.
