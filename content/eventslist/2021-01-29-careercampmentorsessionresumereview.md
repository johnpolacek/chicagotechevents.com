During this interactive, small group session, you'll have your resume reviewed by an expert in a supportive environment, and you'll have the ability to listen and learn with some of your peers as their resumes are reviewed within your group. Please note, mentor sessions are extremely limited. Please only reserve a seat if you plan to have your resume prepared and comfortable sharing it with a small group.
