Join Chicago ML for an evening featuring Kubeflow, the machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes. We're featuring two presentations:

- Introduction to machine learning automation with Kubeflow
- Case study using Kubeflow from Maven Wave

Kubeflow automates machine learning workflows in Kubernetes. It's used to manage standardized platforms for distributed training and model hosting. In the presentations, you'll learn the basics of this important tool and see how it can accelerate deep learning by leveraging multiple GPUs.
