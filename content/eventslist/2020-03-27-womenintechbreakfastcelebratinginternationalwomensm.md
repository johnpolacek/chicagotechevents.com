More than 39 percent of women work in industries where women make up at least three-quarters of the workforce. This is indicative of a growing trend over the last few decades but barely represents parity in the general sense. In the spirit of International Women’s Month, join General Assembly, ReviewTrackers, and Schedule Engine in bringing together leaders from major companies across our global network to discuss how together we can change this trend.

Hear from a panel of experts on difficult topics affecting not only women in the workforce but organizations at all levels. Our speakers will discuss unconscious biases uncovered during their journeys, the importance of taking an in-depth look into your company's culture, and actionable takeaways you can implement into your talent pipeline strategies for meaningful impact.

This event is, of course, open to all genders — anyone who supports the careers of women and those identifying as women in business and tech are welcome to attend.
