The second part of this interactive workshop series goes deep into goal setting, how to create a career roadmap, and the steps to move forward after establishing a clearer view of where you want to go.

You’ll walk away with an advanced understanding of micro-goal setting and skills and techniques to ensure goals are associated with growth not simply tasks.

Ideal for anyone who feels unsatisfied at work, wants more, but isn’t quite sure what that would be. Focus is on exploring your goals and taking actionable steps on them. This program also includes a 1:1 mini-coaching session.
