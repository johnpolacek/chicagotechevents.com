Bring your laptop and learn how to code Serverless applications! (Setup instructions at the bottom) Serverless computing is a powerful build and execution modern cloud model, but it is a bit of a misleading name. There are certainly servers, but as an application developer you rely on the cloud provider to manage that infrastructure for you. You may have also heard of this model as "functions as a service". In this "hands on lab", Pratik Patel will start with a short introduction to Serverless, what it means to JavaScript developers, and why it's important to understand this technology. We'll touch on the differences and similarities between doing Node.js development and Serverless. And of course, we'll dive in with some coding! We'll write a serverless JavaScript application and do a cloud deployment, while writing unit tests and invocation code.
