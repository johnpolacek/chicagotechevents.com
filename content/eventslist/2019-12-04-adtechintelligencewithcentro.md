Queer Tech Club will close out 2019 with a visit to Centro to network with LGBTQ tech professionals, enjoy refreshments and learn about the work of our latest sponsor, who is committed to developing unified software and services that support the increasingly complex digital media landscape and improve the lives of people working inside it. As one of the fastest-growing ad tech platforms, Centro simplifies and automates digital media operations while driving performance using its digital platform, Basis. This comprehensive media automation and intelligence platform is the only one in the industry that supports the planning, reporting and financial reconciliation of direct, programmatic, search and social media.
