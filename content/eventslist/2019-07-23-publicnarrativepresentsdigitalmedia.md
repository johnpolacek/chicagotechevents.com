Social media is best utilized with a specific goal in mind. In this session, we’ll explore how algorithms impact what is accessible on social media. Participants will be able to define the algorithms of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter. They’ll be able to differentiate original content from curated content while recognizing credible sources for curated content and becoming a trusted provider of original content. We'll explore a variety of strategies and applications that'll support best practices for social media at school and in business.
