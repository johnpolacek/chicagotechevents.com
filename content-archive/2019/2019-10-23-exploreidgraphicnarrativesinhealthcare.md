What do we mean when we say design? Through exploreID, we invite you to explore design at IIT Institute of Design (ID) through different lenses and projects.

In a project funded by UChicago Medicine’s Bucksbaum Institute for Clinical Excellence, ID students and faculty explored how visual narratives could better educate patients about radiation therapy. Understanding radiation treatment can be overwhelming for cancer patients and their caregivers, especially since patients often receive information at points of high emotional stress. Hear Tomoko Ichikawa, clinical professor at the Institute of Design, talk with UChicago Medicine physicians Dr. Daniel Golden and Dr. Brian Callender about how communication design can help patients have more constructive conversations with their doctors.
