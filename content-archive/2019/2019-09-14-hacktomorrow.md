HackTomorrow is a weekend-long hackathon, or invention competition, where participants work to solve a problem they believe should be worked on. With mentors, workshops, free food, and collaborative space, youâ€™ll be able to freely create something with resources and help you might not regularly have access to
Besides the free food, swag, cool prizes, available resources, mentors, job opportunities, and educative workshops, HackTomorrow is an environment that allows you to complete the projects lingering in your mind faster than you thought possible.
