You will join your fellow software developers and write code! Everyone is encouraged to either work on their personal project(s) and general software skills development. During introductions, everyone will have the chance to introduce themselves, inform the group what they'll be working on for the day and ask for assistance or ask if anyone is interested in collaborating with them on their project.
