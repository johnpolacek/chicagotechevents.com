Have you ever wondered how Alexa or Siri recognizes your voice, or how Facebook is able to automatically recognize your friends in pictures? The answer is Artificial Intelligence (AI), or also known as Machine Learning!

In this workshop, students will learn about how machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks learn from data to answer real world questions. They will get insight on and explore how new technologies like Alexa or Siri are able to recognize your voice and learn new commands.
