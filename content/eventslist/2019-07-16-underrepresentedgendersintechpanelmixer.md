The Women and Non-Binary Engineering business resource group at Sprout Social would like to invite you to our panel and mixer for underrepresented genders in tech. The event will kick off with a panel of Sprout tech employees who identify as an underrepresented gender. They will answer questions about their current roles, their career paths into tech and their backgrounds. After the panel there will be a mixer, with designated areas set aside for discussions about particular roles (web, backend, data science, infrastructure, QA, etc.).
