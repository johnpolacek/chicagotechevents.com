In this interactive workshop, we’ll show how you can empower, rather than micromanage, your team to make a shared vision a reality through two critically important tools: powerful one-to-one conversations and radically honest feedback. At the end of the workshop, we’ll create a personal leadership roadmap to help you put your learnings into action.
