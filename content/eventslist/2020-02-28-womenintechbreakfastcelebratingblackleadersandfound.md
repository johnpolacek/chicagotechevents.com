In celebration of Black History Month, The Wing and GA Chicago invite you to join us for this interactive breakfast about how women of color are succeeding in tech and fostering the next generation of leaders in Chicago.

The breakfast will feature an enlightening panel discussion by a handful of amazing women in the Chicago tech scene. We'll take a deeper dive into the issues they face in the tech industry and solutions to how to rise above the obstacles and thrive in this growing field.
