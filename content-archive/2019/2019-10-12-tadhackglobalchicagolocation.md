 TADHack Global 2019 will be the largest telecom focused hackathon in the world with 10 - 15 locations running in parallel around the globe. You’ll learn about adding programmable telecoms to your apps, services or business; be able to share your experiences with others; do some “coding”; and potentially create a winning hack that makes a difference in your community. Oh, and don’t forget about the awesome food and cash prizes.
