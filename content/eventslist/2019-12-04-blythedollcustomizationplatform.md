BLYTHE DOLL CUSTOMIZATION PANEL

When the worlds of fashion enthusiasts and doll collectors collide, Blythe dolls are at the center. These wide-eyed darlings are beloved as a creative outlet for fans who love to pose and style their dolls. But with so many fashion options, how does one get started making custom Blythes? You’ll learn just how at our Blythe doll customization panel!

Ever wonder how to sew your own Blythe doll clothes, resculpt her face, or style her hair? Our group will take fans through the basics of coordination and customization. With the mini petite Blythe, middie Blythes or even the moveable Neo Blythe doll, you will learn how to make your doll unique.

From her humble beginnings in the ‘70s to her modern resurgence in the past few decades, Blythe is about bringing together the style-savvy. Almost every aspect of her can be customized. Her hands, ears, and faceplate can be swapped out to add attitude and personality. Her hair and eyes can be changed to a rainbow of colours and styles to fit any aesthetic. And, of course, there are as many options for her clothing as a lover can dream of.

With so many choices, a Blythe doll is a blank canvas for the fashion-conscious. Give her freckles and braid her hair. Turn her into a fantasy heroine or the girl-next-door. Our customization panel will help you use your imagination to breathe life into your very own Blythe. Once she’s dressed to the nines, our panel will also cover photoshoot basics. Sharing photos of your custom creation is one of the best sources to connect with other fans across the globe.

Collectors and stylists of any skill level can enjoy their own custom Blythe doll. Whether you’re a seasoned collector or a novice, all are welcome to learn and get creative through this imaginative workshop. Plus, you’ll have a chance to join a blooming community of Blythe collectors for an unforgettable experience.
