GraphQL is eating the world, but why? How does it help teams move faster, write reliable software, and have fun? In this talk Mitch will cover core principles of GraphQL and how his team uses it to power their real-time financial research app (built on React Native)! Mitch is a software engineer at EEON Finance. He's a junkie obsessed with React, React Native, Node, and GraphQL and loves our little developer corner of the world.
