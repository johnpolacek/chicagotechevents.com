Interested in learning how to apply design thinking in a hands-on environment? Want to see how real strategists and HR leaders apply design thinking to solve challenges? Excited to gain exposure within the HR and hiring fields?

Casecomps is hosting a free design thinking session in partnership with Flatiron Chicago and Welch Packaging to teach foundational design thinking techniques to passionate data experts, UI/UX designers, and business strategists. Food and refreshments will be provided.

What you’ll do: Apply real design thinking techniques to help Welch Packaging, a regional leading box manufacturer serving clients throughout the country, reimagine it's hiring process for production associates to remain competitive within a tightening labor market. Participants will be broken into teams, walked through design thinking activities, and present solutions at the end of the event. Winning teams of the friendly competition will receive tours of mHub, Chicago’s physical product accelerator.
