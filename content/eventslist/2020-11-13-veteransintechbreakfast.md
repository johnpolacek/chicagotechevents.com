This event is part of General Assembly's Women in Tech Breakfast series. This month, we'll be featuring some of the most successful veterans in the global community. Five speakers will share inspiring personal stories of transition, how they prepared for workforce re-entry, hurdles they faced along the way, and how they navigated career success.

Veterans and non-veterans alike will be rewarded with our speakers' hard-won insights regarding their specific experience in the tech industry. Come prepared to listen and learn from these talented individuals!
