Whether we like it or not, social media isn’t free anymore. More and more social networks are adapting a “pay-to-play” business model that’s forcing startups to spend part of their budget on ads to achieve their business goals. In this workshop you’ll discover how to best utilize the ads platforms of each network and what networks make the most sense for your business. Also discover what’s new in the social media landscape and how ads are going to evolve in the coming year.
