In this final part of this 3-part series program participants will learn ways to more effectively find and apply to jobs, as well as masterfully communicate what it is that they want to do and how their past experience relates to desired opportunities.

You’ll learn expert-level insight on navigating a strategic job search for making a career change and learn how to finally explain any shifts, gaps, or non-traditional parts of your work history.

Ideal for anyone who feels unsatisfied at work, wants more, but isn’t quite sure what that would be. Focus is on job search and how to explain changes and gaps in work history. This program also includes a 1:1 mini-coaching session.
