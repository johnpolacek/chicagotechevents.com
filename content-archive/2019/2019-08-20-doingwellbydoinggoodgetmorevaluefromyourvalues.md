A huge body of evidence shows that increasingly, people want to make more of a difference with their lives - through their careers and the products they buy. Evidence also shows that businesses must respond to survive and thrive in the future - companies like Unilever, Google and Coca-Cola are all changing their business strategy to put social and environmental purpose alongside profit at their core. For startups who need to impress customers and get the most out of employees on limited budget, it’s a must have.

Join NCSA (Next College Student Athlete) and General Assembly Chicago to learn the secrets of how to find, live and engage others in your organization’s social purpose.
