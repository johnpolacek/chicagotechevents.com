Underutilization, poor working condition, aging or maintenance-related challenges, unexpected downtime and no local suppliers for spares, are some of the biggest challenges that businesses face today. Delays in timely repairs to malfunctioning machines lead to obsolescence. Furthermore, inaccuracy in production can make it tough for companies to ensure compliance and maintain quality.

Todayâ€™s technology such as machine learning and AI can help you identify problem signals early so that you can effectively avoid unplanned downtime and cost impact due to decreased yield or quality. In this webinar, we will show you how automatic detection of anomalies in business processes can empower companies to detect problems in minutes and helps them overcomes problems with a system that relies on traditional thresholding. Our speaker will also discuss the roadmap to deploy smart solutions powered by AI to take the first leap in the realm of digital transformation.
