Join us for computer.art: dream, our events follow a show and tell format; attendees are welcome to present their creative coding project, and talk about it. Be mindful of your time, try to keep it under 10 minutes. We encourage first time presenters to show off what they've created! Our theme for the event will be dream, the goal of the theme is to give a prompt for people to inspire them to create or show off something. We don't enforce the theme, just want to help people be inspired who use technology as an artistic tool.
