General Assembly Chicago invites you to join us for our monthly Women in Tech Breakfast series featuring women in tech and entrepreneurship to provide insight on how they reached their level of success, advice on navigating the workplace, and how we can help the next generation of women in tech succeed.
Join us for lightning talks by a handful of incredible women in the Chicago tech and entrepreneurship scene. We will take a deeper dive into the issues women face in the tech industry and find solutions to how we can rise above the obstacles and thrive in this growing field.
