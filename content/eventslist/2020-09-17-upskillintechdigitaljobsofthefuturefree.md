In collaboration with Dress for Success, General Assembly is hosting an event focused on upskilling in today's digital age. We'll hear from industry professionals who have either pivoted their careers completely or have skilled up their tech careers. They'll share more about their professional journeys, personal hurdles, and various educational opportunities in order to help you discover the best next step for you and your career. 
If you're looking to change careers or even boost your current one please join us and our dedicated panelists for an evening of learning and sharing to get started on your new career path!
